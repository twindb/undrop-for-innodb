TwinDB Data Recovery Toolkit is a set of tools that operate with MySQL files at low level and allow to recover InnoDB databases after different failure scenarios.

The toolkit is also known as **UnDrop for InnoDB**, which is more accurate name because the toolkit works with InnoDB tables.

The tool recovers data when backups are not available. It supports recovery from following failures:

- A table or database was dropped.
- InnoDB table space corruption.
- Hard disk failure.
- File system corruption.
- Records were deleted from a table.
- A table was truncated.
- InnoDB files were accidentally deleted.
- A table was dropped and created empty one.
